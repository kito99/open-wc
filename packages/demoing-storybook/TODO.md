Need:

- make it a breaking change (e.g. become 1.0.0)
- update README.md
- update MIGRATION.md
- make storybook-start work on IE11

Nice to have:

- Blog Post?
- export needed stuff from '@storybook/addon-docs' via prebuilt... so we do not need the dependency
- Investigate tree shaking / compiling smaller bundle
- Review if all addons are worth their weight
- Allow configuring static files (copy job) in build config
- Allow extending rollup configuration
- mdx transform sourcemaps
